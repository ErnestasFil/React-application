                        The Platform team at Simbuka is involved with many projects across many different teams.
                        Thatâ€™s why it is important for us to build software in a highly reusable manner, that could be
                        used
                        in many different scenarios. We value clean, simple-to-understand code, given the complex
                        business requirements we often entail.
